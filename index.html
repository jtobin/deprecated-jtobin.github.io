  <div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly 41 days ago I started a project called <a href="http://750words.com">750 Words</a>,
which is simply a habit of writing a meagre 750 words every day.  They can be
written on anything; just pick a topic (or several topics) in your head and get
to writing about it.</p>

<p>When I originally started, I thought that this would be a great way to work on
blog posts, research papers, my dissertation, and so on.  Not so much the case,
I’ve found.  After much internal debate as to its merits (the subject of at
least one entry), the best use that I have found far 750 Words thus far has
been a complete mind dump every morning over breakfast.</p>

<p>Initially I tried rigorously picking a topic and writing essays and technical
entries or what have you, but this seemed to actually go against the spirit of
the exercise.  Nowadays I just open the browser and crank out whatever’s on my
mind.  It generally takes me about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Why do I deem this productive?  More than anything, I think, it has been by
observing the results over time: I’ve sustained a streak now for 37 days
straight, and quite enjoy waking up every day and putting another X on the
calendar by virtue of writing another entry.  I don’t want to stop, and indeed,
don’t intend to.  The main reward to me has been  seeing a basic goal manifest
as a string of X’s on a calendar; the little 750-word-minimum mind dumps (which
constitute over 32,000 words now) are a bonus.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’ve always been interested in measure theory.  I’m not even sure why, exactly.
Probably because it initially seemed so mysterious to me.  As an undergrad,
measure theory was this unknown, exotic key to <em>truly</em> understanding
probability.</p>

<p>Well, sort of.  It’s certainly the key to understanding formal probability,
but it no longer seems all that exotic, nor really necessary for grokking what
I’d call the true essence of probability.  It’s pretty much real analysis with
specialized attention paid to notions of factoring (independence) and ratios
(conditioning).  Nowadays I relate it moreso to accounting; not the most
inspiring of subjects, but necessary if you want to make sure everything adds
up the way you think it should.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>EC2 is cool.  The ability to dynamically spin up a whack of free-to-cheap
server instances anywhere in the world at any time, is.. well, pretty mean.
Need to run a long computation job?  Scale up a distributed system?  Reduce
latency to clients in a particular geographical region?  YEAH WE CAN DO THAT.</p>

<p>The EC2 Management Console is a pretty great tool in of itself.  Well laid-out
and very responsive.  But for a hacker’s hacker, a great tool to manage EC2
instances (amongst other things) is Ansible, which provides a way to automate
tasks over an arbitrary number of servers, concurrently.</p>

<p>With EC2 and Ansible you can rapidly find yourself controlling an amorphous,
globally-distributed network of servers that are eager to do your bidding.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/EE2uqkU.jpg" /></p>

<p>Again.. pretty mean. </p>

        <h1 class="entry-title"><a href="/blog/2013/12/20/side-projects/">Managing Learning as a Side Project</a></h1>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I regularly find myself wanting to learn too many things at once.  This might
be justifiable in some sense; there’s an awful lot out there to learn.  Often,
skimming over some topic or other feels like enough to develop a sufficiently
high-level model of what it is or how it works.  Armed with that (dangerously
small amount of) knowledge, however, the urge to pick up some other topic tends
to arise..  and so the process repeats.</p>

<p>This is all well and good in order to survey what’s out there, but left
unchecked, a survey of topics is all one might get.  <em>Le dilettantisme</em> can be
understandable, but never desirable.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I decided to try restricting myself to learning only one
particular topic for two weeks at a time, as a bit of a side project.  Think of
it as a ‘learning sprint’, if you will.  The idea is that the time between
iterations is sufficiently short to ensure that one can’t hunger too badly to
switch to some other topic mid-sprint.  At the same time, each iteration is
lengthy enough to ensure a reasonable amount of immersion and depth.</p>

<p>I managed a single iteration, but due to travel and a lack of conviction about
the whole thing, never started another.  I think I’m going to start again, but
with a little more intent this time.</p>

<p>Two weeks can be a long-as time for some topics, though, so I believe I’ll work
in one-to-two week commitments, depending on the subject.</p>

<p>To start, I’m going to choose <a href="http://zeromq.org/">0MQ</a>, a framework that I
sort-of know and definitely love.  We’ve used it in production on a previous
app I worked on, and I’ve even contributed to the official Ruby bindings.  But,
I still have a lot to learn about it.</p>

<p>So let’s see how it goes.</p>
