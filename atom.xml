    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I regularly find myself wanting to learn too many things at once.  This might
be justifiable in some sense; there’s an awful lot out there to learn.  Often,
skimming over some topic or other feels like enough to develop a sufficiently
high-level model of what it is or how it works.  Armed with that (dangerously
small amount of) knowledge, however, the urge to pick up some other topic tends
to arise..  and so the process repeats.</p>

<p>This is all well and good in order to survey what’s out there, but left
unchecked, a survey of topics is all one might get.  <em>Le dilettantisme</em> can be
understandable, but never desirable.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I decided to try restricting myself to learning only one
particular topic for two weeks at a time, as a bit of a side project.  Think of
it as a ‘learning sprint’, if you will.  The idea is that the time between
iterations is sufficiently short to ensure that one can’t hunger too badly to
switch to some other topic mid-sprint.  At the same time, each iteration is
lengthy enough to ensure a reasonable amount of immersion and depth.</p>

<p>I managed a single iteration, but due to travel and a lack of conviction about
the whole thing, never started another.  I think I’m going to start again, but
with a little more intent this time.</p>

<p>Two weeks can be a long-as time for some topics, though, so I believe I’ll work
in one-to-two week commitments, depending on the subject.</p>

<p>To start, I’m going to choose <a href="http://zeromq.org/">0MQ</a>, a framework that I
sort-of know and definitely love.  We’ve used it in production on a previous
app I worked on, and I’ve even contributed to the official Ruby bindings.  But,
I still have a lot to learn about it.</p>

<p>So let’s see how it goes.</p>

the better.</p>
