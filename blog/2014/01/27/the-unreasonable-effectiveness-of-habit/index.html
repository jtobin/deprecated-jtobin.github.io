<div class="entry-content"><p>Exactly 41 days ago I started a project called <a href="http://750words.com">750 Words</a>,
which is simply a habit of writing a meagre 750 words every day.  They can be
written on anything; just pick a topic (or several topics) in your head and get
to writing about it.</p>

<p>When I originally started, I thought that this would be a great way to work on
blog posts, research papers, my dissertation, and so on.  Not so much the case,
I’ve found.  After much internal debate as to its merits (the subject of at
least one entry), the best use that I have found far 750 Words thus far has
been a complete mind dump every morning over breakfast.</p>

<p>Initially I tried rigorously picking a topic and writing essays and technical
entries or what have you, but this seemed to actually go against the spirit of
the exercise.  Nowadays I just open the browser and crank out whatever’s on my
mind.  It generally takes me about 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Why do I deem this to be a good use of my time?  More than anything, I think,
it has been by observing the results over time: I’ve sustained a streak now for
37 days straight, and quite enjoy waking up every day and putting another X on
the calendar by virtue of writing another entry.  I don’t want to stop, and
indeed, don’t intend to.  The main reward to me has been  seeing a basic goal
manifest as a string of X’s on a calendar; the little 750-word-minimum mind
dumps (which constitute over 32,000 words now) are a bonus.</p>

<p>I’d often heard about the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret">‘chain’ method</a>
attributed to Jerry Seinfeld for boosting productivity, but kind of dismissed
it as ‘not a good fit’ for me (whatever that means).  I’ve been productive in
various endeavours by just <em>doing</em> the thing in question - playing musical
instruments, swimming, coding - without feeling I actually needed to resort to
keeping track of a formal chain or what have you.  Slavish devotion to schedule
is a bit foreign to me.  And,
<a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/01/13/write-every-day-is-bad-advice-hacking-the-psychology-of-big-projects/">not everyone recommends it</a>.</p>

<p>When it comes to writing, however, the same approach hasn’t seemed to work.</p>

<p>I’ve always found technical writing to be a difficult task, and have
historically resorted to binging to get the job done.  But, binging on a
tough activity is unpleasant, unpleasant activities breed anxiety, anxiety
breeds procrastination, and procrastination leads to guilt.  The cycle is what
I would call ‘supremely sub-optimal’. </p>

<p>I read a great book about a week ago called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Write-Lot-Practical-Productive-ebook/dp/B001Y35G60">How to Write a Lot</a>
which advocates as its primary advice <strong>allotting regular time to write, and
writing during that time</strong>.  In other words, enforcing a habit by slavish
devotion to schedule. </p>

<p>It has now been six days since I started forcing myself to specifically do some
technical writing for at least two hours a day, and marking an X down (using
<a href="http://dontbreakthechain.com">dontbreakthechain.com</a>) when that goal is
completed.  And, seemingly miraculously, much of a dissertation chapter has
materialized from thin air - sans the anxiety, procrastination, and guilt I
normally associate with working on it.</p>

<p>Of course, I’m only six days into this ‘habit’ of mine, so let’s see how long
it lasts in practice.  But, I really can’t imagine it going away: the decrease
in stress and accretion of results I’ve observed in only six days has been
amazing.  If I somehow start finding a two hour commitment too burdensome, I’ll
just knock it back to one hour instead.  And if that winds up being too
strenuous (in which case I probably have bigger problems to worry about) I can
go to thirty minutes or even less.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences">Math</a>
and <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/35179.pdf">data</a> are well-known to be
‘unreasonably effective’ in some sense, but habit just might be as well.</p>
